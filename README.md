Implementations of some optimal control algorithms

### Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator
* Available inside pylqr (adapted from https://github.com/navigator8972/pylqr.git)
* A simple example of 2-DOF planar robot reaching a target is provided in ``` 2DOF_arm.py```

### Model predictive path integral control 
* ```mppi.py``` provides an example implementation of mppi as per Algorithm 2 from this [paper](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~bboots3/files/InformationTheoreticMPC.pdf)
* In the above an example of openai gym pendulum is implemented
